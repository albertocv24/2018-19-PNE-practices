Here you will take your notes
Client server model(starts the communication)
Client send a request to the server and the server response to the request
The problem starts when the client send a request and there is no server to attend it, it's like something you can't buy
First activate the service
You can have one computer running two programms
We are going to try to communicate comkputers separated physically
There is no wire to communicate both programms

Concepts we need
Inside the Internet there are many computers divided in groups called networks
All the computers have networks interface, the IP address refers to the network interface, so one computer can have more
than one IP address

My phone IP address at URJC is: 10.0.40.225
Check again at home my IP address and write it down:
Teacher's IP: 212.128.253.64

My IP from my computer is: 212.128.253.91


There is a command called ping to ask the computer if the it is alive ping 8.8.8.8
* ping time to 8.8.8.8

time = 3.54ms

*Ping time to my computer: time = 0.023 ms (23 us)

Ping time of Lucia's computer is 0.02 ms

My ping time of my mobile phone: time = 72.8 ms

URL : use for identify a computer

*Ping to www.google.com : (216.58.211.228)

*Ping to urjc.es: (212.128.240.50)

Port number where is located the server

s2 = s1.reverse()
s3 = s2.complement()
s3.strbase ---> server
